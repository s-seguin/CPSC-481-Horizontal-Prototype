## About:
This is a high-fidelity prototype for an ondering kiosk to be implemented at the Kilkenny Irish Pub.
It allows users to order food and drinks, create up to 8 tabs per table to keep orders seperate as well as browse 
the full Kilkenny's menu and call the server for help if needed. When fully implemented, it will be tied into the 
POS system and the existing kitchen order system, so that orders can be sent directly to the cooks and payment can
be processed at the table.

## How to use:
Double click on the 'Application.exe' file, or open the project in Visual Studio 2015 and click start.
The application will then load to the welcome screen. From here users need to create a tab to get started.
Once a tab has been created, the user can add food or drink to their order tray where they can decided to 
either send the order to the kitchen or remove items from their order. Once the order has been sent to the kitchen, 
the user is able to pay for their order. Once a tab is payed off, it is removed from the list of tabs. If all tabs 
are payed off, then the application goes to the home screen. Up to 8 people can create a tab on the kiosk at any
given time. Users can leave by paying their owing tab. If none of the tabs owe any money the exit button in the
bottom right hand corner will bring the application back to the main screen.
